# A send off to Test Engine
I wasn't sure where to put this, so README will do. This is a final send off to Test Engine. There won't be anymore re-runs or new versions. Test Engine is cancelled.
I would like to thank everyone who's been here throughout it's 7 month lifespan, I know development has been on and off, and very rocky at that. But after a team decision, we decided it's best to let it go, and focus our priorities on Funkin' Revised.
Development of the engine has been fun, but there have always been issues, such as a former team member and an executive having issues with each other. (More detail in the discord server, also being shut down soon.) 
I hope to see Revised become what we had hoped Test would've been.

Goodbye, Test Engine. It's been a pleasure working on this mod.

Former project leader and coder,

Megalo
